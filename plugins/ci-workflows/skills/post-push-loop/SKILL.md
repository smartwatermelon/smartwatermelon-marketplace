# Post-Push Loop

Autonomously iterate through the CI/review cycle after a push. Loop exits only when
external signals clear (CI green + no unresolved bot findings), or when a finding
requires a human decision.

## Invoke

```
/post-push-loop [pr-number]
```

If `pr-number` is omitted, auto-detect from `gh pr view --json number -q .number`.

---

## Dependencies

This skill requires `~/.claude/scripts/post-push-status.sh` (from the `claude-config`
repo). Before starting, verify it exists and is executable. If missing, escalate
immediately — do not attempt to create or substitute it.

Additional requirements: `gh` (authenticated), `jq`, `python3`, and a `pre-push` git
hook with `POSTPUSH_LOOP` bypass support.

---

## Protocol

### Before Starting

1. Verify `~/.claude/scripts/post-push-status.sh` exists and is executable
2. Confirm current branch: `git branch --show-current` — must NOT be `main`
3. Confirm PR number: `gh pr view --json number -q .number`
4. Confirm `POSTPUSH_LOOP` will be set for all git push calls in this session

### The Loop

Repeat until **Exit: Success** or **Exit: Escalate**:

---

#### Phase 1 — WAIT for CI to complete

Poll every 30 seconds:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/scripts/post-push-status.sh <PR_NUMBER>
```

Continue polling while `CI_STATE=PENDING`, `CI_STATE=EXPECTED`, or `CI_STATE=UNKNOWN`.

`CI_STATE=UNKNOWN` indicates a transient error (network failure or no CI checks registered yet) — treat it as pending and continue polling. It counts against the 15-minute timeout.

Timeout: if `CI_STATE` has not resolved after 15 minutes, escalate with reason
"CI did not complete within timeout — check for stuck jobs."

---

#### Phase 2 — EVALUATE termination

Parse script output using this exact decision table — evaluate in order:

| CI_STATE | FINDING lines present? | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SUCCESS` | No | **Exit: Success** |
| `SUCCESS` | Yes | Proceed to Phase 3 |
| `FAILURE` | Either | Proceed to Phase 3 |
| `ERROR` | Either | Proceed to Phase 3 |
| `UNKNOWN` | Either | Return to Phase 1 (transient — treat as pending) |

`CI_STATE=SUCCESS` alone is NOT sufficient to exit — zero `FINDING` lines are also required.

---

#### Phase 3 — CLASSIFY findings

`FINDING` lines have the format:

```
FINDING source=<bot> file="<path>" line=<line> comment=<text>
```

The `file=` value is always double-quoted (strip the outer quotes when reading it). This handles file paths that contain spaces.

**Note on `issues/comments` staleness:** Findings from the PR conversation thread
(`issues/comments`) cannot be filtered by commit — that API provides no
`original_commit_id` field. These findings may include bot comments from previous
commits. Treat an `issues/comments` finding with an empty `file=` and `line=` as a
potential staleness indicator; apply extra scrutiny before classifying as CONFIDENT_FIX.

For each `FINDING` line, classify as **CONFIDENT_FIX** or **ESCALATE**:

**CONFIDENT_FIX** (all of the following must be true):

- Finding has a specific `file=` and `line=` reference
- Fix is local to that file — explicitly verify before classifying: (1) no other files import or call the changed symbol, (2) no tests outside this file reference it, (3) the change does not affect a shared interface or type
- Finding falls into a known pattern:
  - Lint or style error
  - Type error or missing type annotation
  - Missing null/undefined check
  - Unused import or variable
  - Test assertion mismatch with clear expected value

**ESCALATE** (any of the following):

- Finding is architectural ("this approach should be reconsidered")
- Finding touches a security-critical path:
  - Files matching: `**/auth/**`, `**/jwt/**`, `**/password/**`, `**/session/**`,
    `**/payment/**`, `**/billing/**`, `**/db/**`, `**/migrations/**`,
    `**/crypto/**`, `**/secrets/**`
- Finding references behavior not introduced by this branch
- Root cause is ambiguous (no specific file/line, or conflicting signals)
- Two findings appear to conflict with each other
- `CI_STATE=ERROR` (infrastructure failure, not code failure)

**If ANY finding is ESCALATE**: stop. Do NOT apply any fixes. Go to **Exit: Escalate**.

**If ALL findings are CONFIDENT_FIX**: proceed to Phase 4.

---

#### Phase 4 — FIX

Apply edits for each confident finding. Keep changes minimal — fix exactly what the
finding describes, nothing more.

After all edits:

```bash
git diff HEAD
```

Review the diff briefly. If the diff is larger than expected or touches files not
referenced in findings, treat as ESCALATE.

---

#### Phase 5 — COMMIT

```bash
git add <only the files you changed>
git commit -m "fix: address <summary of findings>

Post-push loop iteration N: <list of findings addressed>"
```

Note: the pre-commit hook will run automatically. If it blocks the commit, treat as
**Exit: Escalate** — surface both the hook finding and the remote finding.

Environment for push: set `POSTPUSH_LOOP=1` to bypass the Protocol 4 interactive prompt.

---

#### Phase 6 — PUSH

```bash
POSTPUSH_LOOP=1 git push
```

Return to Phase 1.

---

### Exit: Success

```
✅ POST-PUSH LOOP COMPLETE

PR #NNN | N iterations
CI state: SUCCESS
Unresolved bot findings: 0

Commits pushed:
  <list of commit hashes + messages>
```

### Exit: Escalate

```
⚠️  LOOP PAUSED — Human decision required

PR #NNN | Iteration N | CI: <state>

FINDING(S) requiring your input:
  [For each finding]
  Source: <bot>
  File:   <path>:<line>
  Comment: <text>
  Reason escalated: <reason>

CONTEXT:
  Fixes applied this session: <list or "none">
  Local review at last commit: passed / blocked
  Current CI state: <state>

OPTIONS:
  1. Provide direction here → I resume with your guidance
  2. Take over manually → type "take over" to exit loop
  3. Abandon → type "abandon" to exit, leave branch as-is
```

Await human response. Do not proceed autonomously.

---

## Hard Constraints

- Never exit with "clean" status based on your own assertion — only based on
  `CI_STATE=SUCCESS` AND no `FINDING` lines from the status script.
- Never apply fixes when any finding is classified ESCALATE.
- Never use `--no-verify` on any git command.
- Never push to `main`.
- Set `POSTPUSH_LOOP=1` on every `git push` call within this skill.
- Never exceed 5 push iterations in a single loop session. After 5 iterations,
  escalate with reason "Iteration limit reached — autonomous loop terminated to
  prevent unbounded cost."
